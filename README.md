# bird-collision-analysis (and the cleaning before that)

Please refer README.pdf to see how to run the scripts in this repository. 

The scripts in this repository seek to analyze the bird-collision-data collected in Downtown Chicago and McCormick Place made available via this [paper](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8rr0498). But before that, we need to clean the dataset and impute the missing data. The current state of the project is mostly a demonstration of the data cleaning I did to make the data ready for deeper analysis. Currently, some basic analysis and a summary dataset are available.
